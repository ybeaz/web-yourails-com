# YouRails - Discover AI and People, the New Environment for a Better Life

YouRails is an open-source React Native chat project for networking people and AI personas. The project facilitates the creation of AI personas and the organization of various interaction scenarios easily and naturally.

## App Concept

- Chat First Application<br />
  Users choose the right open profile at the right time to establish meaningful connections and instantly chat with others in real time.

- People and AI personas together<br />
  The app is designed to facilitate people-to-people communication, help people create/present/update/delete AI personas quickly, market, and manage a mixed environment.

- Multiple User Profiles<br />
  Users can create, customize fields and manage multiple profiles that reflect their current goals and intentions. Profiles can be set to public, private to specific users, or accessible with a link. Users also have the option to temporarily disable or delete their profiles.

- Content and Content Management<br />
  Users can enjoy creating and promoting content along with the profile. This makes public profiles discoverable and visible at the time and to the extent the user wants them to be.

- AI-Person and People Discovery<br />
  Users now use a simple profile search by words and phrases. As a separate feature, AI-based search can be implemented to instantly discover the right people based on their profiles, chat metadata, and integrated APIs (including Teams, Slack, email, etc.). This feature can help users find solutions and connect with like-minded individuals. In business, it can be a game-changer, accelerating all business processes.

- Digital Business Card<br />
  The app functions as a digital business card, providing a unique link (QR code) to the user's online profiles. This allows the user to share relevant contact information (such as email, telephone, LinkedIn, Telegram, Instagram, etc.) for seamless communication.

- Emphasis on Information Security<br />
  The app supports third parties JWT token authentication integration (such as Amazon Cognito, etc.) This requires the server support.
